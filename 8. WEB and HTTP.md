> ### Types of Ports
>
> 1. **Network Ports**:
>    - Network ports are used in networking to identify specific processes or services on a device over the internet or a local network.
>    - Each port is associated with a number, called the *port number*, and is typically combined with an IP address to uniquely identify a service.
>    - Common port numbers include:
>      - **80** for HTTP (web traffic)
>      - **443** for HTTPS (secure web traffic)
>      - **22** for SSH (secure remote login)
> 2. **Hardware Ports**:
>    - These are physical interfaces on a computer or network device, such as USB, HDMI, Ethernet, etc.
>    - They allow connections for peripherals like keyboards, monitors, and network cables.
>
> ### How Network Ports Work
>
> In networking, a *port number* is assigned to each packet that is transmitted over the network. Each device listens on certain ports to allow different types of communication. When data is sent to a device, it includes a port number that tells the system which application or service should handle that data.
>
> ### Port Ranges
>
> - **Well-Known Ports (0–1023)**: Reserved for standard services and protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP).
> - **Registered Ports (1024–49151)**: Used for user-defined applications and services.
> - **Dynamic/Private Ports (49152–65535)**: Generally used for temporary or private connections.
>
> ### Why Ports Are Important
>
> Ports help maintain efficient communication and enable various services to operate on a single IP address by directing incoming data to the correct application.
>

> typically, each application that needs network access on your PC will use a unique port or set of ports to communicate, especially if it requires a continuous or dedicated connection. Here’s how it generally works:
>
> 1. **Unique Ports for Server Applications**:
>
>    - Applications that act as 
>
>      servers
>
>       (e.g., web servers, database servers) listen on specific, often predefined, ports. For instance:
>
>      - A web server might listen on **port 80** (HTTP) or **port 443** (HTTPS).
>      - A database server might listen on **port 3306** for MySQL.
>
>    - These applications stay ready to receive incoming connections on their assigned ports.
>
> 2. **Ephemeral (Temporary) Ports for Client Applications**:
>
>    - When your PC acts as a *client*—for example, when you browse the web or connect to an online service—temporary ports are used.
>    - The operating system assigns a high-numbered *ephemeral port* (usually in the range 49152–65535) for the duration of the connection.
>    - This allows multiple instances of the same application or different applications to communicate with servers without conflict.
>
> 3. **Port Reuse and Management**:
>
>    - Many applications can use the same port number on different machines without conflict, as long as they aren't running on the same machine at the same time.
>    - Some applications that only need outgoing connections do not need specific ports; they let the operating system assign ports dynamically.
>
> When you use Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge at the same time, both browsers will connect to different websites or services over the network. Each connection will involve different ports, especially because each tab or webpage you open usually gets its own *ephemeral (temporary) port* for outgoing connections. Here’s a breakdown of what happens:
>
> 1. **Ephemeral Ports for Outgoing Connections**:
>    - Both Chrome and Edge act as clients when connecting to websites. They use ephemeral ports, which are high-numbered ports dynamically assigned by your operating system.
>    - For each new connection (e.g., when you open a new website or tab), the OS assigns a unique ephemeral port number (usually in the range 49152–65535).
> 2. **Examples of Port Assignments**:
>    - Let’s say you open *google.com* in Chrome. Chrome might get assigned ephemeral port **49160** to connect to *google.com* on its standard HTTP or HTTPS port (port **80** or **443**).
>    - Meanwhile, if you open *example.com* in Edge, Edge might use ephemeral port **49161** to connect to *example.com* on port **443** (for HTTPS).
>    - <MARK>Each connection will have a unique combination of your PC’s IP address and ephemeral port, plus the destination’s IP and port (usually **443** for secure connections).</MARK>
> 3. **New Ports for New Connections**:
>    - If you open additional tabs or websites, each new connection will be assigned a new ephemeral port to avoid conflicts, regardless of which browser is making the connection.
